### Map origin

The image is based on the map in "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World-Compact.svg" obtained 6:th of December 2021, which was released into the public domain.

### Other

Certain regions which have their own codes in the maps do not appear as marked in the application. This will be fixed.
